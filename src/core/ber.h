     * the expected parameter types are:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>
     *     b  Boolean.  An int parameter should be supplied.
     *     A boolean element is output.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *     e  Enumeration.  An int parameter should be supplied.
     *     An  enumeration  element is output.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *     i  Integer.   An int parameter should be supplied.
     *     An integer element is output.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *     B  Bitstring.  A pointer to a QByteArray which contains the
     *     bitstring is supplied, followed by the number of bits in the
     *     bitstring.  A bitstring element is output.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *     n  Null.  No parameter is required. A null element is output.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *     O,o,s  Octet  string.  A QByteArray * is supplied.
     *     An octet string element is output.
     *         Due to versatility of Qt's QByteArray, these three format
     *         strings are all accepts the same parameter, but using the 's'
     *         format the string will be encoded only to the first zero
     *         character (a null terminated string)!
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *     t  Tag.  An int specifying the tag to give the next element
     *     is provided. This works across calls.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *     v,V  Several octet strings. A QList<QByteArray>* is supplied.
     *     Note that a construct like ’{v}’ is required to get an actual
     *     SEQUENCE OF octet strings. Also note that the 'v' format recognizes
     *     the QByteArray only to the first zero character, so it's not
     *     appropriate for binary data, just only for null terminated strings!
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *     {  Begin sequence. No parameter is required.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *     }  End sequence.  No parameter is required.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *     [  Begin set.  No parameter is required.

     *   <li>
